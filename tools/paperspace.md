## Part I:  Creating a Machine
### Step 1:  Where to start
- click on this link:  https://www.paperspace.com/console/machines

### Step 2:  Create a new machine
- select green button `New Machine`

### Step 3:  Choose region
- pick a data center
- Regions:  there are 3 regions available
   - West Coast (California)
   - East Coast (New York)
   - Europe
- pick the one closest to you; (for me it is East Coast (NYC));  if a region is unavailable, try another region.  (West Coast may be unavailable for some machines).  

### Step 4:  Choose template
- Select `Public Templates`
- Select icon for `fast.ai`
- Ignore warning about contacting Paperspace about this template. It applies to the default selected, not fastai.

<img src="../images/paperspace_fastai.png" align="center"  height="400" width="650" >   


### Step 5:  Choose machine
- there are various machines with charges noted by the hour

- if you choose the P4000 or P5000 machine, it may ask you to contact Paperspace asking why (anti-fraud step); let them know it is for **fast.ai** and they will get you up and running (this may take several days...)
- Machines to choose (whichever you prefer and is available in your region of choice)
  - the **M4000**  (cheap, no paperspace authorization needed)
  - the **P4000**  (~2x M4000 and same price, but must get authorization)
  - the **P5000**  (better P4000, more expensive, need auth.)

### Step 6:  Choose storage
- note that you pay for storage as soon as you start the machine up
- select `50 GB` option; unless you are sure you need more (applies to data storage only, not OS install)
- storage costs are pro-rated (like compute (or "usage") costs)

### Step 7:  Options
- turn ON `Public IP` (cost is `$3/month`)
- turn OFF `Auto Snapshot` (to save money on doing back-ups)

### Step 8:  Payment
- add in promo code
- add in credit card information (required, even if you have a promo code)

### Step 9:  Create machine
- select `Create your Paperspace` box
- you'll see the new machine "provisioning"
- It may take several hours (4-5 hrs) to receive the confirmation email from Paperspace due to high demand
- you'll receive an email with subject *"Your new Paperspace Linux machine is ready"*
  - a temporary password will be included in that email
```text
Your temporary sign-in password for machine New Machine 1 is: *************

You can ssh into your new machine with the following command:ssh paperspace@184.###.###.###

Happy computing!
- The Paperspace Team
```

(fastai) paperspace@psgyqmt1m:~$ 
```

### list the files
- <kbd> ls  </kbd> lists all the files
```
(fastai) paperspace@psgyqmt1m:~$ ls
anaconda3  data  downloads  fastai
```

### list the data files
- <kbd> `ls data` </kbd> lists the data contents for first part of this course
```bash
(fastai) paperspace@psgyqmt1m:~$ ls data
dogscats  dogscats.zip
```

### list fastai files
- <kbd> ls fastai </kbd> lists everything for this course
```bash
(fastai) paperspace@psgyqmt1m:~$ ls fastai
CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md  courses  environment.yml  fastai  LICENSE  MANIFEST  MANIFEST.in  README.md  README.rst  requirements.txt  setup.cfg  setup.py  tutorials
(fastai) paperspace@psgyqmt1m:~$
```

## :red_circle: Part III:  Updating fastai repo contents
* :key:  this step is important as having updated content and libraries can bypass errors

### Step 1:  go to directory
<kbd> cd fastai </kbd>  
```
(fastai) paperspace@psnqh1ltz:~$ cd fastai
(fastai) paperspace@psnqh1ltz:~/fastai$ pwd
/home/paperspace/fastai
(fastai) paperspace@psnqh1ltz:~/fastai$
```

### Step 2:  update repo 
<kbd> git pull </kbd>  
- from time to time, you should pull the latest `fastai` repo from GitHub
```bash
(fastai) paperspace@psnqh1ltz:~/fastai$ git pull
Already up-to-date.
```

### Step 3:  update Python / Anaconda libraries
<kbd> conda env update </kbd>  
- do this from time to time (every few weeks)

### Step 4 (optional): Update password and apply root password
<kbd>passwd</kbd> and <kbd>sudo passwd</kbd>
- Current password = temp from Paperspace email
- Root (sudo) currently has no password... we should set that too.
```bash
(fastai) paperspace@psjs5366a:~$ passwd
Changing password for paperspace.
(current) UNIX password:
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated successfully
(fastai) paperspace@psjs5366a:~$ sudo passwd
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated successfully
(fastai) paperspace@psjs5366a:~$
```

## Part IV:  Paperspace & Jupyter Notebook
### Step 1:  `cd` into fastai directory
- make sure you are here:  `/home/paperspace/fastai`
```bash
(fastai) paperspace@psgyqmt1m:~/fastai$ pwd
/home/paperspace/fastai
(fastai) paperspace@psgyqmt1m:~/fastai$
```

### Step 1.5: Fix Jupyter Notebook config file
<kbd> jupyter notebook --generate-config </kbd>
- The config file was previously set up by default to allow remote access, but updated jupyter notebook breaks.
```bash
(fastai) paperspace@psgyqmt1m:~/fastai$ jupyter notebook --generate-config
Overwrite /home/paperspace/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py with default config? [y/N]
```

### Step 2:  Launch Jupyter Notebook (now with more config!)
<kbd> jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8889 --NotebookApp.allow_remote_access=True</kbd>
- the config settings can be written permanently into /home/paperspace/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py.
- The reason to change port=8889 will be clear in a minute.

```
(fastai) paperspace@psgyqmt1m:~/fastai$ jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8889 --NotebookApp.allow_remote_access=True
[I 20:37:41.604 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/paperspace/.jupyter

```

### Step 2.5:  SSH into machine and redirect <i>local</i> localhost to machine localhost
- open a terminal or cmd window on your <b>local</b> machine 
- <kbd>ssh -N -L localhost:8888:localhost:8889 paperspace@your.public.ip.here</kbd>

```
C:\Users\Me>ssh -N -L localhost:8888:localhost:8889 paperspace@184.###.###.###

- keep this cmd window open. It appears to hang after enter on password, but all good.
- this was sourced from https://hsaghir.github.io/data_science/jupyter-notebook-on-a-remote-machine-linux/
- For a more permanent solution, see **Optional** section below

### Step 3:  Get Notebook url
- copy jupyter notebook URL <kbd>http://localhost:8889/?token=a7a724c1ba8d4c91132834c2d076298f517002227d4e8a72</kbd>
- paste url into your local browser (example:  Chrome, Firefox, Opera, etc) and change port from 888**9** to 888**8**
- :boom: Hooray, it works! :smiley:   
- alternately, bookmark <kbd>localhost:8888</kbd> and use the token <kbd>a7a724c1ba8d4c91132834c2d076298f517002227d4e8a72</kbd> to log in.
    - Note: the token changes each time you restart jupyter notebook on the Paperspace machine

## Part V:  Workflow
I opened the [Lesson 1 notebook](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/courses/dl1/lesson1.ipynb), made a copy with the name `tmp-reshama-lesson1.ipynb`  

http://184.###.###.###:8888/notebooks/courses/dl1/lesson1.ipynb


## :red_circle: Part VI:  Shutting down Notebook & Machine
### :red_circle: Remember to shut the notebook down and STOP Instance! :moneybag: :red_circle:

- Paperspace has an option where you can choose to automatically shut down your machine at: 1 hr, 8 hrs, 1 day, 1 week
- I chose the `8 hrs` option
- :key: Note that the auto shut down works only for the browser console. **Paperspace will not auto shut down your server if you SSH to it.**
- [How do I use Auto-Shutdown on my Linux machine when connecting through SSH?](https://paperspace.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002807447-How-do-I-use-Auto-Shutdown-on-my-Linux-machine-when-connecting-through-SSH-)

# Optional Steps 
## Skip password and updating IP address in Jupyter Notebook link

## Setup:  Simplifying Logging in to Paperspace
Note:  the below commands are run on * **YOUR LOCAL COMPUTER** *

### Step 1:  Install `ssh-copy-id`
If you don't have it already, here's how to install it (Mac):  
```bash
brew install ssh-copy-id
```

### Step 2:  Ensure public keys are available
- `cd` into `~/.ssh` directory
- if you don't have an `.ssh` directory in your home folder, create it (`mkdir ~/.ssh`)
- if you don't have an `id_rsa.pub` file in your `~/.ssh` folder, create it (`ssh-keygen` and hit <kbd> Enter </kbd> 3 times)

### Step 3:  Copy public key to Paperspace
- replace IP address in syntax below with your own, and run command
```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub paperspace@184.###.###.###
```
### Step 4:  Add Paperspace info to `config` file
- make sure you are in the right directory
```bash
cd ~/.ssh
```

- if you don't have a `config` file, create one.  This example creates file using nano editor.  
```bash
nano config
```

- add these contents to your config file (replace IP address here with your Paperspace IP address)
```text
Host paperspace
     HostName 184.###.###.###
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
     # StrictHostKeyChecking no  
     User paperspace
     LocalForward 8888 localhost:8889
```
- here's the nano command for saving file  
<kbd> ctrl o </kbd>    
<kbd> Enter </kbd>  

- here's the nano command for exiting a file  
<kbd> ctrl x </kbd>
>my example of config file
```bash
% pwd
/Users/reshamashaikh/.ssh
```
```bash
% cat config
Host paperspace
     HostName 184.###.###.###
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
     # StrictHostKeyChecking no  
     User paperspace
     LocalForward 8888 localhost:8888
```

### Step 5:  `ssh` into Paperspace from local computer
```bash
ssh paperspace
```
>my example
```bash
